# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

- Found API with data I'm going to use for the project. I'm not interested in maintaining an up-to-date registry of all the podcasts on the web. [ListenNotes](https://market.mashape.com/listennotes/listennotes) was the clear winner here. It's also freemium-based :smiley:
- Did research on which starter project I'd like to use. Considering [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gastby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
- Researching what I'm going to use for the back end. Considering [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Sails](https://sailsjs.com/), and also considering [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).
- After doing all the tech research, I realized I needed to have a clearer idea of what exactly I'm building. That way I can pick the tech that fits the problem.
- I decided I want to blog all of this and document it along the way. I was typing notes this whole time in Evernote - why not publish it? I need to decide if I'm going the Medium/LinkedIn approach or running my own with GastbyJS. This feels like an awesome opportunity to try out Gastby.
- Okay so I'm hosting my own. I bought a domain too :smiley:
-

**Thoughts:**
It's really easy to go longer than an hour after just getting started. I think that's going to be the key to this.

### Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

- Missed this day. Spent a lot of effort preparing for an upcoming sprint at [Spreetail](https://www.spreetail.com) and my boss took us all out for drinks to celebrate.

**Thoughts:**
Doing this _every_ day is going to be harder than I thought.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

- Updated my GatsbyJS site to actually use their blog starter. Then updated the blog with a intro post from me, used my pictures, etc.

**Thoughts:**
GatsbyJS is super nice. I think I see a lot of potential for smaller & bigger applications using this tech.

**Link to work:**

- Still need to publish this
- Here's an image though

### Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

- Updated my GatsbyJS site with an about me page. I learned a little bit of GraphQL in the process.
- Published the new site to AWS Amplify

**Thoughts:**
GraphQL looks nice so far! I'd like to get it into a little heavier of an application and see if I like it in that scenario. Right now though, it's great with GatsbyJS.

### Day 5: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**:

- Tried to switch DNS for my Google domain to work with my S3 bucket on AWS. Steuggled with this for quite awhile.

**Thoughts:**
I'm considering deploying on Google just so that the domain will play nicer with the assets.

**Link to work:**

- No link today - I just struggled with DNS/AWS/Google.
